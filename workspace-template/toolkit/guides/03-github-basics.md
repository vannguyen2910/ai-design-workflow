# GitHub Basics

This guide is for people who have never used GitHub. You do not need to read it to get started: option A in [`01-get-the-folder.md`](01-get-the-folder.md) needs no account. Read it when you want to save your work to GitHub.

## Seven words

| Word | Meaning | Picture it as |
|---|---|---|
| **Git** | Software that records the history of changes of a folder | An "undo" button for a whole folder |
| **GitHub** | A website that stores folders that use Git | Google Drive, but it remembers every change |
| **Repository** (repo) | A folder stored on GitHub | A project folder |
| **Template** | A sample repo you create your own copy from | A sample file you "Save as" |
| **Clone** | Download a repo to your machine | Download the folder |
| **Commit** | Save a point of change, with a one-line note | A "Save" button with a message attached |
| **Push** | Send the saved points from your machine to GitHub | Sync your copy to the internet |

## What you need to do

You only do four things, all by clicking buttons in **GitHub Desktop**, no commands to type:

1. **Clone** your repo to your machine. Once.
2. Work in the folder as usual.
3. **Commit** when you finish a piece of work, with a one-line note.
4. **Push** so your copy goes to GitHub.

The detailed clicks are in the "Option B" part of [`01-get-the-folder.md`](01-get-the-folder.md).

## Private or public?

| | Private | Public |
|---|---|---|
| Who sees it | Only you, and the people you invite | Anyone with the link, including search engines |
| Use it for | A full project: context, data sources, working files | Only a project you are allowed to share in full |
| Markdown shown on GitHub | Yes, for invited people | Yes, for everyone |

A simple rule: **the repo that holds your project stays Private.** Only create a separate Public repo, from a cleaned copy, when the whole project may be shared. See [`04-share-your-hub.md`](04-share-your-hub.md).

## Common worries

| You worry | In reality |
|---|---|
| "If I click wrong I lose files" | Each commit is a point. You can always go back to an earlier version |
| "Can anyone see my work?" | In a Private repo only you can see it. Others see it only when you invite them or send the link |
| "I got a strange message" | Take a screenshot and ask whoever shared the template, or a colleague. Meanwhile you can keep working: Git does not stop you from editing files |
| "Everything is a mess" | Download a fresh ZIP, then copy the files you edited into the new folder |

## Do not commit

Do not save these in the repo, even a Private one:

- Passwords, API keys, tokens
- Users' personal data (names, emails, phone numbers, recordings with real names)
- Unpublished financial or strategic figures of the company
- Company files you are not allowed to take outside

A Private repo is still a place on the internet. If you are not sure, anonymise before saving.
