# Get the Folder

Setting up for the first time? The [setup checklist](00-setup-checklist.md) walks you through everything in order, with a check after each step. This guide explains the options in more detail.

This guide helps you get the workspace onto your machine. There are two ways, and you only need to pick one.

**Never used GitHub? Pick option A.** You can use this workspace without an account.

| | Way | GitHub account needed | Backed up | Good when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | Download ZIP | No | No, you back it up yourself | You want to start right away |
| B | Use this template, then GitHub Desktop | Yes (free) | Yes, with change history | You want an automatic backup |

## Where to keep it

Put the folder somewhere ordinary on your machine, for example `Documents`.

**Do not put it in Google Drive, iCloud, OneDrive or Dropbox.** An AI coding tool writes many files at once, and a folder that syncs to the cloud can break halfway. If you want a backup, use option B.

## Option A: Download ZIP

1. Open the GitHub page of the repo (the link comes from whoever shared the template).
2. Click the green **Code** button, then choose **Download ZIP**.
3. Unzip the file you just downloaded:
   - Mac: double-click the file.
   - Windows: right-click, choose **Extract All**.
4. Drag the unzipped folder into `Documents`.
5. Open the folder. You will see `README.md`, `toolkit`, `my-project` and `demo-project`.

**Backup:** from time to time, compress `my-project` into a ZIP file and put it away, or copy it to another drive. The end of each work session is a good moment.

## Option B: Use this template, then GitHub Desktop

This creates your own **repo** (a repo is a folder stored on GitHub). You keep it **Private**, so only you can see it.

### Part 1: Create your repo

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in. No account yet? Click **Sign up** (free).
2. Open the GitHub page of the repo that the template's sharer sent.
3. Click the green **Use this template** button, then choose **Create a new repository**.
4. In the **Repository name** box, enter a name, for example `my-design-workflow`.
5. Choose **Private**.
6. Click **Create repository**.

Cannot see the **Use this template** button? Use option A, or message the person who shared the template.

> **Do not download the original repo directly to save your work.** You have no write access to it, so your changes cannot be saved there. Create your own repo with **Use this template** first.

### Part 2: Bring the repo to your machine

1. Install **GitHub Desktop** from [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com) and sign in with your GitHub account.
2. Choose **File**, then **Clone repository**. (Clone means download a repo to your machine.)
3. On the **GitHub.com** tab, choose the repo you just created.
4. In the **Local path** box, choose `Documents`.
5. Click **Clone**.
6. Choose **Repository**, then **Show in Finder** (Mac) or **Show in Explorer** (Windows) to open the folder.

### Part 3: Save your work

Do this after each time you finish a piece of work:

1. Open GitHub Desktop. The left column lists the files you changed.
2. At the bottom left, type a one-line summary, for example `Discover: scope and user-voice synthesis`.
3. Click **Commit to main**. (A commit saves a point of change, with a message. `main` is the main branch, just leave it as it is.)
4. Click **Push origin** in the top bar. (Push sends those points to GitHub.)

These four actions are everything you need to know about Git. The words you just met are explained further in [`03-github-basics.md`](03-github-basics.md).

## Check before you start

- [ ] The folder is in `Documents`, not in a folder that syncs to the cloud.
- [ ] You can see `my-project` and `demo-project` in the folder.
- [ ] You can open `my-project/README.md` and read it.

Opens, but tables and links look raw? That is normal: Markdown files need a viewer. See "View markdown files" in [`02-set-up-your-project.md`](02-set-up-your-project.md).
