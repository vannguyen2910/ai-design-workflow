# Gates

The four gates (checkpoints) a project goes through. Each check has a status: `open` (not done), `passed` or `failed`. **Do not rename a check, only change its status.** A gate passes when all of its checks pass. A check marked **hard stop** cannot be passed with a reason: it must really be met.

## Gate 1: Discover (Question + evidence)

| Check | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1a | The business question and outcome are agreed with the product owner, or marked **assumed** with the agreement status | passed |
| 1b | Every insight traces back to a source you can open (quote, participant ID, timestamp). **Hard stop** | passed |
| 1c | Nothing is guessed: unknowns and counterexamples are recorded; the AI draft sits next to the checked version, with the error rate and a list of what the AI left out. **Hard stop** | open |
| 1d | The evidence comes from at least two kinds of source, the sample size is stated, and what the sample cannot tell you is written down | open |
| 1e | At least one counterexample was sought and recorded ("searched, none found" counts), and the synthesis prompt does not state your own hypothesis | open |
| 1f | Participants consented, the transcript was anonymised before it was pasted, and the raw data is kept outside what the AI reads. **Hard stop** | open |
| 1g | The tool, version, key prompts and your changes to the AI output are logged | open |

## Gate 2: Define (Evidence + agreement)

| Check | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 2a | Every opportunity points to the evidence behind it | passed |
| 2b | The problem brief is signed by product and business, or the agreement status is recorded | passed |
| 2c | Every hypothesis has a test and a metric (an unconfirmed metric is marked **assumed**) | passed |
| 2d | The principle checks are written as yes/no questions | open |

## Gate 3: Develop (Alignment)

| Check | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 3a | At least three different directions were explored; the choice and its reason are recorded | open |
| 3b | Every decision traces back to an opportunity with evidence and to a hypothesis (no decision without a user need, no opportunity left out) | passed |
| 3c | Every decision passes the principle checks, or the conflict is recorded as a trade-off | open |
| 3d | The prototype uses the design system and the accessibility rules that were checked | open |

## Gate 4: Deliver (Real users + buildability)

| Check | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 4a | Real users tested the hypotheses; results are set next to the baseline | failed |
| 4b | Findings trace back to the original notes or recordings and are ranked by importance | open |
| 4c | A developer can build without coming back with questions (handoff pack and decision log are complete) | open |
| 4d | The measurement plan was given to the product owner | open |

The **Automatic check** column (in the report) shows whether the current data meets that check. It does not change the status you set; if you set `passed` and the data does not support it, the report shows a warning.

After you change a status here, ask the AI tool to update the Gates table on the Overview page ([`README.md`](../README.md)).

## Notes on the statuses (demo version)

The statuses were set by the person who built the demo, based on the original documents; the project owner needs to confirm them again.

- **1a, 2b `passed`:** there is no real product owner, but the agreement status (`not available`) and the figures are recorded as `assumed`.
- **1c `open`:** there is no AI draft to compare with, so an error rate cannot be calculated.
- **1d to 1g `open`:** added on 2026-10-15 when Gate 1 was extended; they have not been assessed for the demo project yet.
- **2d, 3c `open`:** the yes/no questions for the 10 principles have not been written.
- **3a `open`:** the project has 26 solutions in the Solution Pool but no step of choosing between three directions yet.
- **4a `failed`:** the only test round used simulated people, which does not meet "real users tested the hypotheses". Run E2 with real people to change this status.
